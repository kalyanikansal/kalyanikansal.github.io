I am a PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at [Johns Hopkins University](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/), advised by [David Savitt](https://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/). I am broadly interested in number theory and arithmetic geometry. 

I did my undergraduate studies at [Government Medical College, Chandigarh](http://gmch.gov.in/), where I earned a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degree (MBBS, equivalent to the American MD degree). Following this, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University before transitioning to Mathematics.

Here is my [CV](https://kalyanikansal.github.io/files/Resume.pdf).
