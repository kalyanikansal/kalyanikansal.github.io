I am a PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at [Johns Hopkins University](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/), advised by [David Savitt](https://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/). I did my undergraduate studies in medicine and surgery at [Government Medical College, Chandigarh](http://gmch.gov.in/).

I am broadly interested in number theory and arithmetic geometry.

Here is my [CV](https://kalyanikansal.github.io/files/Resume.pdf).
