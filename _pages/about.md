I am a PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at [Johns Hopkins University](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/), advised by [David Savitt](https://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/). I am broadly interested in number theory and arithmetic geometry. 

Here is my [CV](https://kalyanikansal.github.io/files/Resume.pdf).


### Math papers

1. Codimension one intersections between components of a moduli stack of two-dimensional Galois representations. In preparation.
2. Smoothness of components of the Emerton-Gee stack for GL2, joint with [A. Guzman](https://sites.google.com/math.arizona.edu/awguzman/), [I. Kountouridis](https://mathematics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/iason-kountouridis/), B. Savoie and [X. Wang](https://www.xiyuanwang.website). [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09439.pdf).



### Non-math work

I did my undergraduate studies in Medicine and Surgery at [Government Medical College, Chandigarh](http://gmch.gov.in/), following which I was a post-doctoral research fellow in Psychiatry. Here is a [link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UL4WLlIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) to my Google Scholar profile containing a list of my non-math publications.
