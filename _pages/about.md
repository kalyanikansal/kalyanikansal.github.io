I am a PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at [Johns Hopkins University](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/), advised by [David Savitt](https://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/). I am broadly interested in number theory and arithmetic geometry. Here is my [CV](https://kalyanikansal.github.io/files/Resume.pdf).


I did my undergraduate studies in Medicine and Surgery at [Government Medical College, Chandigarh](http://gmch.gov.in/), following which I was a post-doctoral fellow in Psychiatry. Here is a [link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UL4WLlIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) to my Google Scholar profile containing a list of my non-math publications.
